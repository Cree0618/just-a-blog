Just over a year ago I witnessed the corporate office world and some of its daily operations.  
For me back then, programming was this black-magic like skill that a small group of people can use. At some point I tried to use ChatGPT to write a simple script that automates one of my tasks. The program had to get the latest data from an API and then compare it with an excel spreadsheet. There were more than 100 entities that needed to be checked and the public web UI was slow. The program finished the job in seconds.

With the latest tools available, I’m certain that significant part of office work can be done by a program/LLM. Maybe it can’t do 100% of daily work, but 10% 20%? 30%?
At this point we are just trying to agree on a figure - and that’s the point.

Big companies usually fire 5% of their workforce a year. I believe that LLMs are replacing the workers at roughly this rate.
It’s a very conservative figure and in some professions, the LLM can do more than 50% of the work. Now it's just about getting the tools in a right place.
LLMs will struggle with meetings, human interactions and physical, hands-on, ground work.
But I think the robot/computer will learn fast, precise motor skills and vision will be hard, but how hard? Maybe 10 years?

We achieved controlled nuclear fusion, put humans on the moon, made quantum computers and are soon going to have millions of [these](https://developer-blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Figure-3-new-png.webp).

Context window is going to get bigger, new techniques like [RML](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.24601v1) are going to help prevent context rot, tool use will be big and next gen models are going to get better at using tools.  
Less entering of data in excel sheet. The process of back and forward between you and lawyers just to review the contract - a process that stretched over 3 days and 6 emails will be done in 30 minutes and $20 worth of API credits.
