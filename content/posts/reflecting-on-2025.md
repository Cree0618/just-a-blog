I've made so many mistakes. So many wasted days and opportunities. Gloomy days with very little hope. But I have to admit that I also
learned new things, not nearly as much as I could have but still, I'm smarter then I was before.  But what's really missing is a meaning behind all this.
That's what I want to explore here - **the Meaning**.    

> I have no clue how to write and I will struggle, but that doesn't matter.

### What moves us?
I think it's a **dream about the future**, an **idea** or a **mission**. Humans are able to do incredible things and endure so much if they have a mission
they believe.  
You can see the power of a mission/dream in successful founders and leaders - these people are very good
at selling the dream to others. Usually the more novel and cool the mission is, the easier it is to sell.  

### My goal with this blog
1. Find my own dream about the future
2. Write about interesting stuff I find along the way
3. Learn more
4. Connect with people


### Right now
It seems like I've hit a roadblock, I think these roadblock are in everything, they appear right after you start going deeper into virtually anything.
It's all fun and games, when you're starting out and experience the feeling of turning your idea into reality.  You don't really understand but 
**you can overcome and make it work**. LLMs and the internet, can help you a lot.  

In the last year I was exploring **how to make code do something I want**. I managed to turn many shower ideas into real stuff in the computer that works (usually as intended). 
Looking back, I maybe made a mistake of not documenting any of it - apparently this is the way of doing it if you want exposure, connect with people and 
find new opportunities. But I was never into this sort of stuff so I never shared it. It's really hard to get 
a **working feedback loop** if you spend all your time sitting alone in a room looking at a screen and typing. **This feedback loop is very important.**

### Building this feedback loop
I started by making this blog, next important step is to keep writing here.  
Next post is going to be more interesting.  Just had to start somewhere.
